Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

Each member can access and update their name, email, address, profile photo, education, work status and similar as well records of key lifetime events, dates, quotes, photos, videos and similar.

We may use this information to send reminders of birthdays, and anniversaries and contact you to participate in the community events such as lectures, commemorative days, excursions and other related events.

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential security risks and spam protection (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimise our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our members browse and interact with the Site).
